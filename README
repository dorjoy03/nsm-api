Unit tests written by testing real NSM (Nitro Secure Module) device in nitro
enclave VM in AWS. This is useful for cross checking NSM behavior in QEMU when
running the 'nitro-enclave' machine type. Here are the steps:

1. Build a docker image using the Dockerfile
2. Use nitro-cli to build an EIF file
3. Take note of the measurements from nitro-cli's output
4. Run a real nitro enclave VM in AWS using the EIF file in debug mode
5. Attach console to the nitro VM from the parent EC2 VM
6. Verify from the console output that the tests pass
7. Now test in QEMU by running the nitro-enclave machine type that the measurements
   match the measurements you took note of earlier and that the tests pass as well.

Note: When running nitro enclave VM in AWS in debug mode most of the measurements
are zero so they won't match QEMU's output when all the PCRs are printed. That is
why they need to be matched by taking note of the measurements from the nitro-cli
output when building the EIF file.
